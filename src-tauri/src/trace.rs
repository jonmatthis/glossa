//! Run tracing — the observability substrate.
//!
//! One `Run` = one execution of one agent. Every AI call in the app produces
//! exactly one, built at the single chokepoint in `ai.rs` that every call
//! already passes through. Runs go two places: a bounded in-memory ring (so
//! the UI can ask for history) and the trace bus (so the UI can watch live).
//!
//! Design rules, from `glossa-docs/docs/observability.md`:
//!
//! - **Recording is unconditional.** There is no "tracing enabled" flag —
//!   that would be exactly the dual-path, feature-flagged architecture the
//!   project forbids. Always record; choose only what to *show*.
//! - **`attempts` is a list, not a count.** The corrective-retry loop is one
//!   of the most interesting things the app does and it must be legible.
//!
//! # SECURITY
//!
//! **Record request PAYLOADS only — never headers.** `ai.rs` attaches the API
//! key with `.bearer_auth(...)`; anything that captured "the request" whole
//! would write key material to disk on every single call. Nothing in this
//! module may ever be handed a `RequestBuilder`, a header map, or a
//! `Provider` (which owns `api_key`).
