//! The turn plan — **the** declaration of what a conversational turn does.
//!
//! This table is the single source of truth for three facts that the graph
//! view asserts and the Runner must honour:
//!
//!   1. which operations a turn fires,
//!   2. what each one actually *depends on*, and
//!   3. whether it hydrates the screen on its own.
//!
//! `graph.rs` generates the turn graph from this table — it does not
//! transcribe `commands.rs` by hand. That transcription is how the first
//! version of the graph came to claim `tokenize_learner` depended on the
//! reply, when it only ever needed the learner's own message: a false edge
//! that both lied in the picture and hid ~700ms of available latency.
//!
//! # Derived / reconciled / attested
//!
//! Observability artifacts must be *derived*, not *maintained* — anything
//! maintained independently is a claim, and claims rot. Three strengths:
//!
//! - **Derived** — one artifact; execution and view read the same structure.
//!   Cannot drift by construction. *(this table → the graph's nodes, edges
//!   and hydration)*
//! - **Reconciled** — runtime observation is diffed against the declaration
//!   and disagreement is surfaced. Can still be wrong, but it says so.
//!   *(`trace::reconcile` → the graph view's fidelity banner)*
//! - **Attested** — a human wrote it; only internal consistency is checked.
//!   *(node layout, and prose)*
//!
//! The line: **structure derived, position authored.** Layout being wrong is
//! visible and harmless; a false edge is neither.
