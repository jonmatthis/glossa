//! The AI vocabulary — agents, operations, faculties.
//!
//! **Standard: the OpenAI Agents SDK.** An Agent is an LLM configured with
//! `instructions`, `tools`, and optionally `handoffs`, `guardrails`,
//! `output_type` and `sessions`. The operative test is **instructions plus
//! tools it can invoke**. Something with a prompt and no tools is a model
//! call, not an agent.
//!
//! Measured against that, Glossa has **two agents** — Chat and Coach — and
//! everything else is either a *tool* (a single transformation the Runner
//! invokes) or a *faculty* (perception or action: ears and voice). The
//! orchestrator in `commands.rs::guided_turn` is a **Runner**: deterministic
//! Rust that walks the graph. It is not an agent and must not be called one.
//!
//! This vocabulary is curriculum, not bookkeeping. Glossa is autogogical —
//! using it teaches how it works — so calling a tokenizer an "agent" would
//! actively teach the wrong thing. The `mechanical` flag below is the proof
//! of the distinction: an operation a dictionary lookup can replace
//! (docs/future-work.md) was never an agent.
